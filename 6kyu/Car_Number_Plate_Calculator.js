Introduction:
The car registering system of a city N assigns two types of numbers:
The Customer ID - a natural number between 0 and 17558423 inclusively, which is assigned to the car buyers in the following order: the first customer receives ID 0, the second customer receives ID 1, the third customer receives ID 2, and so on;

Number Plate - assigned to the car and contains the series ( three Latin lowercase letters from a to z) and the serial number (three digits from 0 to 9).
Example: aaa001. Each Number Plate is related to the given Customer ID. For example: Number Plate aaa001 is related to Customer ID 0; Number Plateaaa002 is related to Customer ID 1, and so on.

Task:
Write a function

findTheNumberPlate
which takes the Customer ID as an argument, calculates the Number Plate corresponding to this ID and returns it as a string, considering the following:

The serial numbers start at 001, end at 999 and change in the following order: from aaa001 to aaa999. Some examples:

aaa001, aaa002, aaa003, 
......, 
aaa009, aaa010, aaa011, aaa012, 
......, 
aaa019, aaa020, aaa021, 
......, 
aaa099, aaa100, aaa101, aaa102, 
......, 
aaa110, aaa111, aaa112, 
......, 
aaa998, aaa999 
The series change in the following order:
The left letter changes first, alphabetically:

aaa001...aaa999, 
baa001...baa999,
caa001...caa999, 
...... , 
zaa001...zaa999
As soon as the left letter reached z and the seriesz** has moved through all the serial numbers the middle letter changes alphabetically as follows:

aba001...aba999, 
bba001... bba999, 
cba001...cba999, 
......, 
zba001...zba999, 
aca001...aca999, 
bca001...bca999, 
......,
zca001...zca999,
ada001...ada999,
......,
zda001...zda999, 
......, 
zza001...zza999
As soon as the middle letter and the left letter both reached z and the serieszz* has moved through all it's serial numbers the right letter changes alphabetically as follows:

aab001...aab999, 
bab001...bab999, 
cab001...cab999, 
......, 
zab001...zab999, 
abb001...abb999, 
bbb001...bbb999, 
cbb001...cbb999, 
......,
zbb001...zbb999, 
acb001...acb999, 
......, 
zzz001...zzz999
2.1 When all the possible series and their serial numbers are exhausted the last Number Plate will be zzz999.

Remember!
No spaces are allowed between the characters in the returned string. So 'abc123' is valid, but 'a b c 1 2 3' is not.

If the serial number has less than 3 digits, the missing places should be replaced with zeroes.
Example: serial number '12' should equal '012'; serial number '4' should equal '004'.

Customer ID starts with 0.

Good luck!
